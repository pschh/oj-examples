		<p>A few odds and ends that don't belong any where else.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="#transactions">Transactions</a></li>
			<li><a href="#servlets">Servlets</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 id="transactions">Transactions</h4>
		
		<p>Oddjob doesn't support transactions across several jobs. Given 
		Oddjobs intended use of running batch files, copying files etc. 
		transactions don't really apply. As the breadth of job coverage
		increases to include EJB invocations and JMS support, then 
		transaction support will probably be included.
		</p>
		
		<p>In the mean time, if you want transactions within jobs 
		maybe consider including
		Spring or another transaction supporting framework within Oddjob.
		Thus
		getting the best of the control and monitoring from Oddjob and 
		transactions and other features from the other framework.
		</p>
		
		<h4 id="servlets">Servlets</h4>
		
		<p>Oddjob comes with a number of Servlets that allow Oddjob to
		run in an application container and 
		provide a JSF web front end to allow the jobs in the
		Oddjob servlet to be monitored and controlled.</p>
		
		<p>The OddjobServlet can be used without the web front end if just
		job scheduling is required.</p>
