		<h1>Background And Principles</h1>

		<p>What's it all about.</p>

		<h4 id="beginning">In the beginning</h4>
		
		<p>Once upon a time a developer
		came to a place where there was a bespoke scheduling system. The
		system was running
		over two thousand batch jobs doing sql extracts and ftps and emails
		and sometimes doing them and sometimes not. The development team 
		started writing their more complicated jobs in Java and using 
		Ant to build them and then they realised that they could use ant
		to do most of what their batch files were doing and so started 
		replacing several batch files with one Ant script and this worked very
		well.</p>
		
		<p>The old scheduling system was still not without problems and 
		there began a project to look at a replacement and the developer
		being a big fan of open source looked for an open source solution
		and found:<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/">Quartz</a> 
			which provided scheduling but lacked retry schedules,
			job chaining or job dependencies.
			</li>
			<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> which provided 
			loads of tasks and runtime configuration,
			but is not a scheduler.</li>
			<li><a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon</a> which introduced 
			Inversion of Control and Frameworks</li>
			<li>Soon after there was <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a>, 
			which showed the way ahead was
			non intrusive frameworks and POJO dependency injection but had
			ugly configuration files and no runtime configuration.</li>
			<li><a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a> and 
			<a href="http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/">BeanUtils</a> 
			demonstrated a really neat way of linking job properties.</li>
			<li>Finally <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/">JMX</a> 
			promised it can provide remote control and 
			monitoring (but not without some effort).</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>Unfortunately our developer didn't find a distributed open source 
		scheduling system
		with web and desktop control providing the required flexible 
		scheduling options and an out of the box set of jobs for doing every
		day tasks. Surely there must be such a beast out there but he had
		Googled in vain.</p>
		
		<p>The Company chose a commercial solution and the developer moved on
		into the world of the 'free lance' where survival is all about keeping
		your lance sharp. The developer realised he needed a pet project to
		help him do this - he remembered the beast that had thwarted him before
		and the quest was on.</p>
		
		<p>So he took the ingredients he had gathered on his previous travels 
		and began mixing them, and mixing metaphors, and - well to cut a
		long story short Oddjob was born.</p>

		<h4 id="principles">Principles</h4>

		<p>In creating Oddjob a few guiding best practice principles have helped
		light the way in times of architectural indecision. Hopefully 
		explaining them will help you better understand how to develop with
		and for Oddjob.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><p><b>A non intrusive framework</b></p>
			
			<p>Writing a job, wherever possible, should not involve knowing
			anything about Oddjob.</p>

			<p>A job in Oddjob does not need to implement any Oddjob interface
			or extend any Oddjob class.</p>
			
			<p><i>(Unlike Ant's Task class or Quartz's Job interface)</i></p>
			
			</li>
			
			<li><p><b>Development with standard types</b></p>
						
			<p>A job's properties should be standard types. The
			framework should provide conversions to standard types
			without the job knowing anything about it.</p>

			<p><i>(Unlike Ant tasks which require fileset objects, an
			 Oddjob job can be written with just a File[] property.)</i></p>
			</li>
			
			<li><p><b>Support for user defined types</b></p>
			
			<p>Support for user defined types should also be non intrusive.
			The framework should configure a type and inject it into the
			job without the job needing to do anything.</p>
			
			<p><i>(Unlike Ant references and the, dependency on 
			Project to resolve them.)</i></p>

			</li>
			
			<li><p><b>Visually Configurable Components</b></p>
			
			<p>Oddjob should support GUI configuration.</p>
			
			<p>Although Oddjobs current GUI configuration doesn't really
			make Oddjob available to the masses - It does make configuration 
			easy.</p>
			
			<p><i>(Easier than XML only configuration.)</i></p>
			
			</li>
			
			<li><p><b>Rapid Application Development and Deployment</b></p>
			
			<p>Writing jobs must be quick and easy. Lifecycle and 
			deployment options should be kept a minimum.</p>
			
			<p><i>(Not like EJB!)</i></p>
			
			</li>
		</ol>
