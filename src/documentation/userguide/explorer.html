		<h1>Oddjob Explorer</h1>

		<p>Your window on the Oddjob world. Before moving on let's have a quick
		walk through the 
		Oddjob Explorer views and controls.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#panels">The Panels</a></li>
			<li><a href="#file">The File Menu</a></li>
			<li><a href="#edit">The Edit Menu</a></li>
			<li><a href="#job">The Job Menu</a></li>
		</ul>

		<a name="panels"></a>
		<h4>The Panels</h4>
		
		<dl>
		<dt><b>Job Tree Panel</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays the hierarchy of jobs.</dd>

		<dt><b>Detail View</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays detail on a job selected in the tree view. It consists of
		three panels:</dd>

		<dt><b>State Panel</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays the current state of a job, where available. The time
		is the time the job changed to that state and the exception is the
		full stack trace of the cause of the job being in an exception state.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Console Panel</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays messages written to the console of the job being run. The
		console is shared at a process level so in any one jobs console view you
		will see messages from all jobs in the same process.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Log Panel</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays log messages produced by the job, where available. Log
		messages are of different levels, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR 
		and FATAL. Each level message is displayed in a different colour.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Properties Panel</b></dt>
		<dd>Displays the properties of a job. Some of these properties are
		visible before a job is run because they are constant or default values,
		some will only be available when the job has run.</dd>
		</dl>

		<a name="file"></a>
		<h4>File Menu</h4>
		
		<a href="images/explorer1.gif"><img src="images/explorer1.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="The File Menu"/></a>
				
		<dl>
		<dt><b>New</b></dt>
		<dd>Creates a new Oddbjob.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Open</b></dt>
		<dd>Starts Oddjob with the selected configuration file.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Close</b></dt>
		<dd>Closes the current view and destroys the internal Oddjob. Both
		Open and Exit perform these actions so Close won't be used much. Note:
		you can not close the current view until all local running jobs have
		completed or have been stopped. If a job won't stop then you must
		kill the Oddjob Explorer process. This strategy ensures that no processes
		are left running that a user is unaware of.</dd>

		<dt><b>Save</b></dt>
		<dd>Saves the Oddjob configuration of the currently selected jobs Oddjob,
		or the root Oddjob if no job is selected.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Save As</b></dt>
		<dd>Saves the root Oddjob configuration in a different file.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Recent History</b></dt>		
		<dd>Displays recent file history. Recent file history is stored in
		the directory used to launch Oddjob. When you change this directory
		you loose this history. Launching two Oddjob Explorers will 
		confuse history and only that of the last closed will 
		be persisted.</dd>
		
		<dt><b>Exit</b></dt>
		<dd>Performs Close and exits Oddjob Explorer. The same as closing the
		main window.</dd>
		</dl>

		the current job.</dd>
