	<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
	
	<p>Scheduling in Oddjob is achieved by inserting a job into the job
	tree that asks Oddjob to execute its child job later, but watches its
	child's completion state. There are three scheduling jobs:</p>
	
	<dl>
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Timer.html">timer</a></dt>
	<dd>Execute the child at different times according to the given schedule.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Retry.html">retry</a></dt>
	<dd>Execute the child according to the given schedule until the 
	child completes.</dd>
		
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Trigger.html">trigger</a></dt>
	<dd>Execute the child job when a job elsewhere enters a specific state.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h4 id="timer">The Timer Job</h4>
	
	<p>The Timer is driven by a schedule, The detail of these schedules is
	discussed in the <a href="schedules.html">next</a> section. Setting aside
	the details of the schedules, we can focus on the mechanism of timers with 
	an example:</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/scheduling1.xml}

	<p>This creates two Timers, one that runs all morning, and one that runs 
	all afternoon. Each Timer has a job that it will execute. The Timers are 
	started using a Sequential Job. Starting a timer is quick operation. The timer
	calculates the next scheduled time and then submits the child job to a 
	background execution service for later or immediate execution. It then enters
	an ACTIVE state and displays a sleeping icon. The sequential job
	will then start the second timer.</p>

	<p>If Oddjob is being run with a persister, the timer will save its last
	completed time after each successful execution. If The timer is stopped
	and restarted this time is used to calculate the next execution time.</p>

	<p>
	If the Timer is using persistence then the <b>skipMissedRuns</b>
	property would be used to see if it should skip its missed slots. 
	By default if this sequence was started at 13:00 and it had been 
	stopped after the 11:00 job, the Morning Timer would immediately run the 
	11:15 job followed by the 11:30 job followed by the 11:45 job -
	and simultaneously the Afternoon Timer would run the 12:00 job, followed by
	the 12:15 job etc.</p>		

	<h4 id="retry">Retries</h4>
	
	<p>a Retry job can be used on its own to retry something or it can
	be used within a Timer or Trigger schedule. Here's an example of it being
	used as the child job of a Timer:</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/scheduling2.xml}

	<p>In this example the retry schedule is limited by they schedule of its parent timer.
	The Retry will keep trying the job every 15 minutes until the job completes or 2pm. At this
	point the retry will terminate in an INCOMPLETE state. The main Timer will then reschedule
	it at 7am the next day.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Because the Retry terminates in an INCOMPLETE state, it's possible to use 
	a <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Trigger.html">trigger</a>
	schedule to fire an alert if required.</p>
						
	<h4 id="holidays">Holidays</h4>
	
	<p>Holidays can be accounted for using a
	<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/schedules/schedules/BrokenSchedule.html">broken</a>
	schedule. Here's an example.		
	</p>

	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/scheduling3.xml}

	<h4 id="timezones">Time Zones</h4>
	
	<p>Both the Timer and Retry can be given a time zone. If this is the case, 
	the schedule will be evaluated in that time zone, regardless of the time zone
	of the server. </p>
	
	<p>Time zones can be particularly useful when scheduling a download from
	a server in a different geographical location. By using their time zone the
	schedule will automatically account for their daylight saving time and
	will schedule holidays that span their day not your local day.</p>
	
	<p>Time zones can also be useful when using a server in a different
	region as the backup server. By using time zones for schedules it is possible
	to stop your local server, copy all your configuration files to the backup
	server and start up Oddjob with no impact on scheduled times.</p>
	
	<p>Time Zones can also be used to provide Summer Time (or Daylight 
	Saving Time) configuration. To schedule
	without daylight saving time use a time zone that is fixed 
	such as 'GMT+08'.</p>
			
	<h4 id="trigger">Triggers</h4>
	
		<p>The trigger is a schedule that is job, rather than time, dependent. The
		trigger schedule will run a job when a second job enters a specified 
		state. Triggers are particularly useful for firing alerts.</p>
		
		<p>A trigger schedule can also be used in conjunction with a 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/SequentialJob.html">
		 sequential</a> job and a 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/job/TriggerJob.html">trigger</a>
		 job to provide a schedule that fires
		only when several jobs have completed.</p>
		
		<p>The trigger schedule is relatively easy to configure. Please see the
		reference documentation for more information.</p>

	<h4 id="dependencies">Scheduling with Dependencies</h4>

		<p>The natural cascading nature of job execution through the use of 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/SequentialJob.html">sequential</a>
		and 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/ParallelJob.html">parallel</a>
		jobs means that dependencies within scheduling aren't required as often as 
		they would in other scheduling systems.</p> 
		
		<p>Here's an example that could have been constructed using a single
		Retry but has been contrived to demonstrate using a Trigger to schedule
		with dependences.</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/scheduling4.xml}
		
		<p>The trigger will fire when both files are available.</p>
