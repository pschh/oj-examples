		<h1>Examples</h1>

		<p>Let's see what Oddjob can do.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="#simple">Hello World</a></li>
			<li><a href="#exec">Execute a Batch File</a></li>
			<li><a href="#workflow">Conditional Paths</a></li>
			<li><a href="#scheduling">A Scheduler Example</a></li>
			<li><a href="#sharing">Sharing Jobs on A Network</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>In addition to these examples, there are also many examples
		from the Reference, this User Guide, and the Developer Guide
		in the <code>examples</code> directory</p>

		<a name="simple"></a>
		<h4>Hello World</h4>

		<p>All examples should begin with the simplest example possible and
		here it is!</p>

		<a name="exec"></a>
		<h4>Execute a batch file</h4>
		
		<p>This example demonstrates executing a batch file from Oddjob
			and introduces us to using sequences of jobs
			and variables.</p>

		<p>The example consists of a sequence of two jobs. The 
		first sets a variable, 
		the second executes the batch file with the variable value
		passed in as an argument.</p>

		<a name="workflow"/></a>
		<h4>Conditional Paths</h4>
		
		<p>An 'if' job uses the return state of one job to decide
			which of a number of alternate job branches to execute.</p>
		
		<p>This job uses a random task to simulate jobs executing 
			with mixed results.
			The example is run in a timer loop to
			continually show the flow of events.</p>

		<a name="scheduling"></a>
		<h4>A Scheduling Example</h4>

		<p>This is a demonstration of the flexible scheduling features of 
			Oddjob. A file is downloaded via ftp daily. If the download
			fails after a number of retries an email is sent.</p>

		<a href="images/examples5.gif"><img src="images/examples5.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Scheduling"/></a>

		
		<p>The files are downloaded from the <a href="http://www.cme.com">CME</a>
		ftp site. This is one of the real life scheduling examples that inspired
		Oddjob. Points of interest include that the filename contains the date and
		the files are sourced from different time zones.</p>
		
		<p>The example comes in two forms, a live example that will ftp the files
		back, and an example that substitutes random dummy jobs so the demonstration 
		can still be seen working off line.</p>

		
		<a name="sharing"></a>
		<h4>Sharing Jobs on A Network</h4>

		<p>This example shows how an 
		Oddjob client can be used to monitor Oddjob running on a remote server.
		</p>

		<p>Although here we have the client and server running in the same
		folder.</p>
		
		<p>If this example doesn't work it might be because your machine 
		doesn't recognise
		<code>localhost</code>. When you've learnt about configuring Oddjob
		come back and try changing the client and server configurations to contain
		your network name or IP address.</p>
		
		<p>To see the examples really working across the network
		change the client configuration from
		<code>localhost</code> to the name or IP address of your server and run the
		client example on a different machine.</p>
