		<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

		<p>Often we don't know the exact configuration values for jobs
		when we set them up. But we will know these values when the jobs run.
		A file name might contain a date, an ftp host name might change
		depending on the environment we're running in, etc. Oddjob allows us
		to specify configuration that is evaluated only when the job runs. The
		configuration values are either Java properties, (key/value pairs) or
		the properties of other jobs.</p>
		
		<p>To specify that a configuration value should be evaluated at runtime
		we include syntax of the form ${<i>expression</i>} in the configuration.</p>
		
		<p>For instance echo job could be configured with the text property 
		'Hello ${name}'</p>

		<p>To evaluate name Oddjob first checks for a java property called
		'name', and ten it attempts to evaluate it is a job property expression. 
		The latter we will come to later. First we show you how to define a 
		properties within Oddjob.</p>

		<h4 id="defining">Defining Properties</h4>
		
		<p>Properties are defined within an Oddjob configuration using the 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/properties/PropertiesJob.html">
		properties job</a>. When the job runs, the properties it defines
		become available to other jobs. When the property job is reset or
		deleted, the property definitions are removed and are no longer 
		available to configure other jobs.</p>

		<p>Properties can also be defined outside of Oddjob and inherited. The
		ways in which Oddjob can inherit properties are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Via Java System properties set in the usual way using the -D option 
			on Java start up.</li>
			<li>From properties defined in a file name oddjob.properties 
			in the users home directory.</li>
			<li>Any properties defined in an Oddjob that is running our Oddjob as
			a nested Oddjob.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If a property of the same name is defined twice the value of when
		it was set first set is used instead of the value defined later. This
		means that external properties take precedence over internal properties.
		The order of precedence of external properties is they are listed
		above.</p>

		<h4 id="id">Job Identity</h4>
		
		<p>If a property is not defined as a name value pair, then Oddjob will
		attempt to evaluate the configuration expression as a property 
		of job.</p>
		
		<p>In order to identify a job so it may be referenced from another job
		it is given an 'id'. An id must be unique and must not contain the 
			characters <code>.()[].</code> or <code>/</code>.
		</p>

		<p>To demonstrate using a job's id we'll create a job
		that mirrors the state of our ExecJob.</p>
		
		<p>We'll start with our Exec Job as the only child of a Sequential 
		Job.<p>
		
		We need to give our Exec Job an id which is quite simple. Open it in
		Designer and in the id field on the 
		right enter 'my-job'.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime1.gif"><img src="images/runtime1.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="Setting the Job Id"/></a>
		
		<p>Next we need to add a mirror job. In the jobs list of
		the Sequential Job, add a state:mirror job.</p>

		<a href="images/runtime2.gif"><img src="images/runtime2.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="Create a Schedule"/></a>

		<p>Select the new node and in the job field we need to tell it
		the job to mirror. We do this
		using the notation <i>${job-id}</i> in the configuration field. 
		Oddjob will recognise a ${ }
		character sequence and takes what is between the curly brackets to 
		be the id of job we wish to reference. This happens every time the 
		mirror job is run.</p>
		
		<p>So in the 'Job' field enter the text ${my-job}.</p>

		<a href="images/runtime3.gif"><img src="images/runtime3.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Schedule Details Dialog"/></a>

		<p>Run the sequence, and then reset and run just the Exec Job. You 
		Should see that the mirror job mirrors its state.</p>

		<h4 id="properties">Job Properties</h4>
		
		<p>The configuration settings made in Oddjob Designer set what are known
		as the job's properties. The 'Command' field of the ExecJob
		set a property called 'command'. </p>

		<p>Just as you can reference a job in the configuration file, you can also
		reference a property of a job. The notation for accessing a property is
		<i>${job-id.job-property}</i>. </p>

		<p>As an example let's create a new simple configuration. In Oddjob Explorer 
		select <b>New</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
		Set a <b>sequential</b> job as Oddjob's only job, and then add
		an <b>echo</b> job to it. Set the id of 
		the job to something like "my-echo" and the 'Text' field (or 'text' property)
		to "This will be displayed twice!".</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime4.gif"><img src="images/runtime4.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="First Echo Job"/></a>
				
		<p>Add another echo job to the SequentialJob node but in this echo
		jobs text property enter the value "${my-echo.text}".</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime5.gif"><img src="images/runtime5.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="Second Echo Job"/></a>
		
		<p>Save the configuration and then open it in Oddjob Explorer. The jobs 
		will run immediately and in the console you should see that the
		text has been displayed twice.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime6.gif"><img src="images/runtime6.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="Running Two Echo Jobs"/></a>
				
		<p>When setting the text property of the second job, Oddjob looked 
		up the job with the id of 'my-echo' and then looked
		up the property 'text' of that job.</p>
		
		<p>This substitution is the
		first thing that happens when a job is run. Altering the order of the jobs
		in the example would be OK because the fixed text of the first job 
		is set when the
		job is loaded. Adding a third job to run before the other two which relied
		on the second jobs text property wouldn't work because the second job
		hadn't run and therefore hadn't had its text property set. Adding the 
		third job after the first two would be OK.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob supports more complicated property specifications but for most
		simple situations ${<i>id.property</i>} is all that is needed.</p>
		
		<h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
		
		<p>When discussing the properties of a job there is one job that deserves
		special attention and that is the variables job. While most jobs have a
		fixed properties with names that never change the variables job has properties
		which are defined dynamically at runtime.</p>
		
		<p>As an example we'll replace our first echo job in the previous example 
		with a variables job. Delete the first echo job. Select the 'SequentialJob' and add a new 
		<b>variables</b> job Jobs table. The variables job appears
		at the end of the list which isn't very useful because as its properties
		are created when it runs so we need it to run first. Use the mouse
		to drag the Variables job above the Echo job. 
		Now configure the variables job
		by giving it an 'Id', say 'vars' and in the Named Values section select
		a type of 'value', and enter a name of 'greeting' and then enter 'Hello' in
		the value cell.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime7.gif"><img src="images/runtime7.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Variables Job"/></a>
				
		<p>We have created a variables job that has property called 'greeting' that
		will be available when the job runs. The type of the property depends on
		where it is to be used. The value property is the most common type and
		can be used for text, numbers etc. When a more complicated type is required
		as the property of job then this will be documented in the reference.</p>
		
		<p>We need to change our runtime property in the echo job to match our new
		variables configuration i.e. '${vars.greeting}'. We can then click OK to
		take our new configuration back into 
		Oddjob Explorer and when we run the Sequential job we will see in the
		console output 'Hello'</p>
		
		<h4 id="nested">Oddjobs within Oddjobs</h4>

		<p>As you saw in the examples, an Oddjob job can be <i>nested</i> within
		another Oddjob job. It is possible to access a job within the 
		using the notation <i>${oddjob-id/job-id.property}</i> but more on this in the 
		next section...</p>.
