		<h4 id="installing">Installing</h4>

		<p>Oddjob comes with a web interface. To run the web interface
		you need a Servlet Engine or application server like 
		<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/index.html">tomcat</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob uses a Servlet 3.0 deployement descriptor and so Tomcat 
		Version 7 or above is required.</p>
				
		<p>To install Oddjob on Tomcat simply copy the oddjob.war file supplied
		with the binary distribution of Oddjob to the webapps directory of Tomcat
		and then restart Tomcat.</p>

		<p>With the default Tomcat setup the URL 
		<a href="http://localhost:8080/oddjob" target="_top">
		http://localhost:8080/oddjob</a> will open Oddjob's browser view
		and it will look something like this:</p>
		
		<a href="images/browserview.jpg"><img src="images/browserview.jpg" 
		height="200" width="300" alt="Oddjob Browser Screenshot"/></a>

		<p>When re-running structural jobs, the browser view of the job tree
		lags what's Oddjob is doing so it is necessary to press refresh 
		(sometimes several times) until it catches up.</p>
		
		<p>An automatic refresh in can be entered in seconds, this will have
		the same effect as pressing the refresh button every that number of
		seconds. To cancel the automatic refresh delete simply clear this 
		field.
		</p>
		
		<h4 id="configuring">Configuring</h4>

		<p>The Webapp starts an instance of Oddjob. This will load an Oddjob
		XML configuration file as specified in the web.xml web application
		deployment descriptor.</p>
		
		<p>The web.xml contains lots of comments with further information on 
		the supported properties.</p>
						
		<p>Log levels are controlled by the log4j.properties file in the
		<code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory. By default log level is set
		to INFO for all loggers.</p>
		
		<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Security</dt>
			<dd><p>There isn't any. Browser based authentication
			including a read-only role will be added soon.</p></dd>
		
			<dt>Threads</dt>
			<dd><p>The Oddjob Webapp currently creates threads. This
			isn't allowed by the J2EE specification and many Servlet containers
			don't allow it including Googles App Engine.</p>
			
			<p>In theory the Executions Servlet could be replace with an 
			instance of one that provided OddjobExecutors that didn't user
			ThreadPools - but this is still theory.</p>
